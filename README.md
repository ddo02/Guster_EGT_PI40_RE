The equipment page can be found [here](http://www.guster.com.br/produtos/pi-40-pirometro/)

Guster PI-40 is an equipment that is able to measure Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT).

PI-40 is a device composed by two modules:
- Sensor module, that interfaces with sensors
- Display module, that show the temperatures

The communication between the two modules is over serial communication.

This project is a reverse engineering on the communication protocol between the two modules.
